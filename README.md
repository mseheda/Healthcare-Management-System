# Healthcare and Hospital Management System

## Overview
The Healthcare and Hospital Management System is designed to manage doctors, patients, and their appointments while tracking treatments and assigning doctors to various departments. This system also allows for efficient management of hospital resources and simplifies the retrieval of important data, such as medical history or doctor availability.

## Features
- **Patient Management**: Add new patients, assign them to specific doctors, track their medical history.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Schedule, modify, and cancel appointments for patients.
- **Doctor Management**: View doctors by department, assign them to patients, and track their availability.
- **Department Management**: Efficiently allocate doctors to their respective departments.

## Objectives
The following objectives guide the development of the system:
1. Set up a Web API project.
2. Implement object-oriented programming principles such as:
   - Encapsulation
   - Abstraction
   - Inheritance
   - Polymorphism

## Key Deliverables
- A Web API project that runs without errors.
- Integration of **OpenAPI Specification (Swagger)** for API documentation.
- Class entities with private and public methods and fields relevant to the subject areas.
- At least one example of inheritance (Base and Derived class).
- An abstract class with abstract and implemented methods.
- Usage of `virtual`/`override` and `abstract`/`override` keywords.
- Support for HTTP methods: **GET** and **POST**.
- Code that adheres to clean code standards.

## Expected Output
- Successfully running Web API project with full functionality.
- Clear and well-documented API endpoints through Swagger.
- Effective OOP implementation using encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
